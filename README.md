# K-Fold Cross Validation

This repository contains the code for the project "**K-fold Cross Validation**". The goal of this project is to perform a 5-fold cross validation using a YOLO V5 object detection model. 

The repository is organised as follows:
- The `main.py` file creates the train and test sets and runs perfomr the validation.
- The `args.py` file parses the arguments needed for the execution.
- The `confing.ini` file contains the csv path, class names, image size, batch size, number pf epochs, number of folds, and finaly the path to the YOLO V5 repository.

To run the code, you will need to install the libraries in the `requirements.txt` file. We recommend using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/promo/?source=google&medium=cpc&campaign=14123077402&term=pycharm&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6_CYBhDjARIsABnuSzqkMV4IXzjuVu-enSX0e70lwTUQBmgEFAoSE3uktD045-LG9A0s0acaAqEDEALw_wcB).
